My favorite character's are her creations-intelligent, human, far more intricate than norm-but these two just didn't add up. I felt sorry for them. The heroine had shown such promise in the beginning. What really bugged me, though, was there were periods of time when years pass and they didn't even see each other. It's just the next paragraph, and oh, they're together again. The plot twists were so offsetting and unbelievable. Or maybe this is just one of her earlier books, written before historical romances became less of an I hate you, I love you, let's get it on genre.",

The motor is quiet and the construction is durable. It is a little bit of a challenge to get the lid open the first few times you try but after that it is easy. However our cat sitter has never learned how to master the thing and leaves the lid off and feeds by filling one tray at a time when we are away. I would recommend this feeder to anyone.",

The only gripe I have is that the Werewolf in question is mainly just a big Wolf-Dog, yet they handle it rather well, but despite that it's still a really well-made story. The protagonist is an interesting \"grey area\" type of character, straddling the line between anti-hero and anti-villain. Wish they had made more movies with him.",

I didn't notice any differences from the version I have on VHS from when it was first released, and I believe it was rated \"R\". I might have to go back and check. If you love damsel in distress movies, this one has plenty of that",

It's like someone is tightening a clamp around my head.-Any music under the quality of a 256kbps 44.1kHz MP3 sounds degraded (but that's because it is). Time to upgrade your library to some higher quality MP3s, or better yet FLAC.Other Notes:-Despite the pain endured by listening to music with these, I still keep these on for much of the day. ERMERGERRRD, such sound quality.",

VV & Hotel have a palpable chemistry on-stage that translates beautifully in the studio. There's this raw, urgent, detached energy to their sound that digs right into the soul of Garage Rock. VV's voice is clear and sensuous and Hotel has this sort of hoarse sexy whisper that compliments her perfectly.The fact that they choose to use a drum machine may feel incongruous to some rockers out there. I know it did to me at first. Yet as I've kept coming back to their stuff, I realize that it's part of their 'mystique' and definitely, for me, since there's no one else to compete with, makes this duo even hotter on stage.\"Keep On Your Meanside\" will forever be embedded in my mind and heart, but \"No Wow\" will keep me going until I can see them live again!",

Not really. I used them just one day, trying them with digitally remastered music, even music mixed in *5.1 Surround Sound*, and there was just no boom from the bass, like was promised on the packaging. At a higher volume, the music is slightly more quality, but the music still lacked substance to me.There was this, and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes, and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part. For this and the above reason I am sending these things back.In all, don't get these if you want wraparound headphones and you think \"Sennheiser = Class.\" I suppose these would be more suitable as DJ headphones, but I do not know.",

Miles of rocks and cactus of Colorado will test there durability.The option of getting a great fit is a welcome change to; since I have a wide foot. Most shoes are a one sizes fits few option these are great!!",

More than the negative comments of the scholars, the lack of opposite scholars is disturbing. They colected scholars that are all on the one side, and all of them without an exception have either misunderstood the message of Quran and the prophet or they intentionally divert the message. It would be more convincing if they have brought at least one scholar that could answer the allegations. They sometimes take a verse, without referring to the context of it, skipping the previous two verses that is essential in understanding it. If you have prejudices about islam and want to reinforce them, buy, otherwise buy something at least more objective.",

Well, I call that an insult. For if the masters of Horror are inspiring work like this then they must be stopped! For true Satanic horror read Rosemary's Baby and Dark Debts!",

We know irrefutably she has zero caring or compassion, and places herself above the laws of god and man. She wishes to impose on the American people a socialist and mundane existence that she herself would never even consider (ask William Dale if you do not believe she is a destroyer of lives).Having said that, I held my nose and read. Much like Hillary, the book is shallow and empty. There's nothing here, and anything that could potentially stand on its own as a point of interest is most likely untrue.

Similar sound to MuteMath, The Fray and Snow Patrol on the mainstream side (all favorites of mine) and Leeland, Deas Vail and Ruth (my favorite new Christian bands). \"Thank God\" kicks it off, and I find \"Fighting For Your Heart\" \"Come and Rain Down\" and \"Like A Dream\" to be the other highlights. Excellent debut album and top 10 of 2008 in my opinion!",

That is what the small holes pictured on the perimeter of the blue tip are for. The products delivered were well points with the solid tips (no water jet holes), designed to be installed in an already drilled hole. I called Grady's Online and left a message to that effect along with my contact information so that we could resolve the issue. They have not followed up. I also provided a response similar to this review to an Amazon email request for feedback. I have not been contacted by Amazon either, and the problem of the item pictured vs the item delivered remains. On the high side, the wrong product was delivered promptly.",
